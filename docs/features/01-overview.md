# Product Overview

## Executive Summary

Wareflow is a **local-first warehouse analysis platform** that transforms raw Excel data from various WMS systems into actionable insights through automated analysis and reporting. Unlike traditional warehouse management systems, Wareflow focuses specifically on **post-facto analysis** of warehouse operations with **complete data privacy** - all data stays on the user's machine.

## Problem Statement

Warehouse managers face three fundamental challenges:

1. **Data Fragmentation**: Critical data locked in disparate Excel files with inconsistent formats
2. **Analysis Complexity**: No easy way to analyze operations without technical expertise or expensive WMS
3. **Reporting Burden**: Time-consuming manual report generation with inconsistent formatting

## Solution

Wareflow provides a **plugin-driven, extensible analysis platform** that:
- Imports Excel files from any WMS via **extensible TypeScript plugins**
- Transforms data into a **normalized local schema** (SQLite)
- Automatically unlocks analyses based on available data
- Executes analyses using a **pure TypeScript engine**
- Exports professional Excel reports with one click
- **Keeps all data local** - no cloud dependencies
- Extends functionality through a **plugin system for imports**

## Target Users

## Product Philosophy

### Import-First, Plugin-Based Architecture

```
WMS Excel Export → Import Plugin (TS) → Normalized Data → SQLite → Analysis
                      ↓
                 Transform & Validate
```

The system is built around a **TypeScript import plugin system**:
- **Every WMS needs a plugin** - No two WMS export data the same way
- **Plugins are pure TypeScript** - Type-safe, testable, maintainable
- **Default plugins included** - Common WMS formats supported out of the box
- **Custom plugins** - Users can write plugins for their specific WMS
- **All plugins produce the same normalized schema** - Analyses work consistently

### Data-First Approach

```
Raw Data → Immediate Access → Analysis → Reporting
   ↑                                      ↓
   └─────────── Foundation ────────────────┘
```

The system prioritizes **data accessibility** above all else:
- Raw data must be queryable immediately after import
- No "black box" transformations
- Full transparency in data processing

### Template-Driven Workflows

Templates bridge the gap between raw data and analysis:

```typescript
Template "Basic Warehouse"
├── Required Tables: produits, mouvements
├── Enabled Analyses:
│   ├── ABC Classification
│   └── Inventory Overview
└── Validation Rules:
    ├── Primary key uniqueness
    └── Date format validation
```

### Extensibility by Design

Every component is designed for extension:
- **Analyses**: Add via plugin registration
- **Templates**: Create custom schemas
- **Export Formats**: Define new output templates
- **Data Sources**: Implement new import adapters

## Key Differentiators

| Feature | Wareflow SaaS | Traditional WMS |
|---------|---------------|-----------------|
| Focus | Analysis only | Operations mgmt |
| Implementation | 5 minutes | Months |
| Cost | Low | Very high |
| Complexity | Low | Very high |

### vs. Business Intelligence Tools

| Feature | Wareflow SaaS | BI Tools |
|---------|---------------|----------|
| Learning Curve | Minimal | Steep |
| Warehouse Domain | Pre-built | Generic |
| Excel Integration | Native | Complex |
| Time to First Report | Minutes | Days/Weeks |

### vs. Spreadsheets

| Feature | Wareflow SaaS | Excel Only |
|---------|---------------|------------|
| Data Validation | Automatic | Manual |
| Analyses | Pre-built | Manual formulas |
| Consistency | Guaranteed | Error-prone |
| Scalability | High | Limited |

## Success Metrics

### Product Metrics
- **Time to First Analysis**: < 5 minutes
- **Template Matching Rate**: > 90% auto-match
- **Analysis Execution Time**: < 10 seconds (10K rows)
- **Data Import Success Rate**: > 95%

### Business Metrics
- **User Retention**: > 80% after 30 days
- **Weekly Active Users**: > 60%
- **Report Generation**: > 10 reports/user/week
- **Analysis Extension**: > 20% of users add custom analyses

## Non-Goals

### Out of Scope for v1.0

1. **Real-time Operations**
   - No live warehouse operations management
   - No barcode scanning integration
   - No IoT/sensor integration

2. **Multi-warehouse Orchestration**
   - No cross-warehouse transfers
   - No centralized inventory management

3. **Predictive Analytics**
   - No ML-based demand forecasting
   - No prescriptive recommendations
   - Focus on descriptive and diagnostic analytics

4. **Collaboration Features**
   - No multi-user editing
   - No comment/annotation system
   - No dashboard sharing

### Future Considerations

These may be added in future versions:
- Web-based interface (currently desktop-first)
- Mobile companion app
- API for integrations
- Advanced anomaly detection with ML

## Design Principles

### 1. Simplicity Over Complexity
- Common use cases should be simple
- Power features available but not intrusive
- Progressive disclosure of complexity

### 2. Transparent Data Processing
- Show every transformation step
- Explain analysis results
- Provide data lineage

### 3. Fail Gracefully
- Validate before processing
- Meaningful error messages
- Recovery suggestions

### 4. Performance at Scale
- Virtual scrolling for large datasets
- Lazy loading of analyses
- Background processing for long operations

## User Experience Vision

1. **Launch Application** → Welcome screen
2. **Select Template** → "Basic Warehouse Analysis"
3. **Upload Excel Files** → Drag & drop
4. **Review Mapping** → Auto-detected, minimal adjustments
5. **Import Data** → Progress bar, validation checks
6. **View Dashboard** → Auto-generated overview
7. **Run Analysis** → Click "ABC Classification"
8. **Export Report** → One click, formatted Excel

**Total Time**: < 10 minutes

### Error Recovery
